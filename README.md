# python-game-of-life-ii
My second attempt at implementing Conway's Game of Life in python

Generates an initial random seed and then runs in the terminal until you hit ctl + c to stop.

The grid is displayed on the command line and refreshes periodically with new status updates and the next iteration of the grid.
